Beats-push sys,less amt of cpu,  binary suited to ur machine...	
Logstash

xpack- is suit of plugins,basic authentication ,ml stuff,additional capabitlities.

es can store time series data......
es understands only json.

if you want to do data modelling 

es is nosql ,doesnt check anything with constrains;

why is it popular
-speed :data ->query -> elastic search ->fast
-scalability
-relevance :data queried we need to get relevant data,relevant search

Terms:
node := server ,stores data,
Index: key -value  ,collection  of documents that have similar charachteristics
type:deprecated....why jus check.now we jus have doc type now
document : basic unit of info that can be indexed
shard: Elastic search ,provide ability to subdivide your index into multiple chunks called shards,you need to worry jus abt deciding no of shards
replica: fault tolerance ,copies of shards
if only one node we maintain cluster state...green yellow red......



Q))hadoop and elastic search mei diff?
Hadoop has distributed filesystem which is designed for parallel data processing, while ElasticSearch is the search engine. Hadoop provides far more flexibility with a variety of tools, as compared to ES. Hadoop can store ample of data, whereas ES can't.
q))can they work together?



vim elastic.yml
bin
./elasticsearch
browser : localhost:9200

kibana:used for number crunching ,processing hoti kibana mei. port : 
bins -> ./kibana
browser : localhost:5601
to know about indices : get /_cat/indices
yellow green indices to know about them GET /_cat/indices?v similarly nodes?v health?v 
discover -> check the index we r talking 
Get metricbeat-6.3.2-2018.08.05/
Delete fname
putting data into es:
	put /fname/_doc/1   //2 dala tobhi doc created as it is nosql
{"colname" : "string1" }
to search
	get /fname/_search

to view through ui:go to discover

kibana holds only metadata , it should know details like where es running

data goes to es first -> to let kibana know something has happened we have index pattern.


geoquery->type of query in ES : search usecase

* to query in kibana*
get /fname/_search
{
	"query"{"match":{"col" :"value"}}
